\section{Background}
With the increasing demand of high resolution online videos from
users, video providers implement data centers and user techniques like
content delivery network (CDN). If the content requested by a user is
cached in advance, she would have better access to the content. Since
it is impractical to cache all contents for each user, a decision must
be made to select the cached the contents. Intuitively, the most
visited contents should be cached.
